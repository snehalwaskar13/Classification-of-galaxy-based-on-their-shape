# Classification-of-galaxies-based-on-their-shape
There are billions of galaxies discovered in the universe which are of different shapes. 
These galaxies can be classified into different groups based on their shape. 
We aim for the algorithm using machine learning to classify the astronomical data of galaxies to detect their shape. 
We have used astronomical data which is either made public by the observatories or the data from virtual observatories. 
Our technic will classify the huge dataset of galaxies into the respective type with accuracy.
